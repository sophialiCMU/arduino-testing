/*************************************************** 
  This is an example for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver
  PWM test - this will drive 16 PWMs in a 'wave'

  Pick one up today in the adafruit shop!
  ------> http://www.adafruit.com/products/815

  These drivers use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to  
  interface.

   * In theory the internal oscillator (clock) is 25MHz but it really isn't
   * that precise. You can 'calibrate' this by tweaking this number until
   * you get the PWM update frequency you're expecting!
   * The int.osc. for the PCA9685 chip is a range between about 23-27MHz and
   * is used for calculating things like writeMicroseconds()
   * Analog servos run at ~50 Hz updates, It is importaint to use an
   * oscilloscope in setting the int.osc frequency for the I2C PCA9685 chip.
   * 1) Attach the oscilloscope to one of the PWM signal pins and ground on
   *    the I2C PCA9685 chip you are setting the value for.
   * 2) Adjust setOscillatorFrequency() until the PWM update frequency is the
   *    expected value (50Hz for most ESCs)
   * Setting the value here is specific to each individual I2C PCA9685 chip and
   * affects the calculations for the PWM update frequency. 
   * Failure to correctly set the int.osc value will cause unexpected PWM results
